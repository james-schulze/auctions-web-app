# auctions-web-app
Auctions Web App written in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, SQL, MySQL

This project was to create a mobile optimised auction platform. It also adds user anonymity letting users create auction aliases to sell under which can be changed taking their feedback with them. This can be a free of for sale feature. It has a light banner ad system to generate revenue and auction images can be sold as well.

This project was initially not intended to be free so there are no comments in the code and it is complex. A wise developer once taught me security through obscurity means job security.
